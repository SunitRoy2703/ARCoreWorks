## 1. Monitor Motive:
An Android App that illustrates the basics of ARCore by implementing the following renderers and also considerable amount of shaders. The app imports .obj files and textures from the 3D models(Monitor in this case) from Maya.<br />

**You'll implement:**

* Point Cloud Renderer
* Plane Renderer
* Object Renderer
* Shaders using GLSL
* Utility and helper functions to get support to get up and running with ARCore.<br />
